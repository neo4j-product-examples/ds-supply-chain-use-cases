    "- The Cargo 2000 case study dataset must be loaded into Neo4j. You can do so by running [this notebook](https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/ds-supply-chain-use-cases/blob/main/modeling-eda-visualization-c2k/transform-and-load.ipynb). It should take no more than a few minutes to complete.\n"

    "\n",
    "For a sample dataset we will use the “Cargo 2000” transport and logistics case study [[1]](#1). Cargo 2000 (re-branded as Cargo iQ in 2016) is an initiative of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) that aims to deliver a new quality management system for the air cargo industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below figure shows a model of the business processes covered in the IATA case study. It represents the business processes of a freight forwarding company, in which up to three smaller shipments from suppliers are consolidated and then shipped together to customers. The business process is structured into incoming and outgoing transport legs, with the overall objective that freight is delivered to customers in a timely manner.  You can find out more about the business model in [this blog](https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/supply-chain-neo4j-gds-bloom/) where we explored the dataset in Neo4j Bloom or from the [original data source]( https://s-cube-network.eu/c2k/).\n",

    "In `part1-route-optimization-single-paths.ipynb` we showed how shortest path algorithms can be used to recommend routes between an origin and a destination. While helpful, this doesn’t directly optimize the problem for our freight forwarding network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this dataset the goal of a shipment is to get freight from multiple origins to a single destination. As such, the real business problem is not in optimizing single paths, but optimizing a process that takes freight from *multiple* origins and sends them to a single destination. If we measure cost by the effective time of the business processes, then we can combine freight from multiple origins over different segments or legs to reduce cost. i.e. we can reduce total time in transit by combining freight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving this problem by brute-force is computationally expensive and scales poorly, becoming infeasible for large graphs. As a result we need some sort of approximate solution.\n",
