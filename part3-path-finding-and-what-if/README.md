# Graph Data Science for Supply Chain: Part III
## Path Finding, Optimization, and Recommendation for Supply Chain and Logistics

This directory contains a notebook for replicate the analysis in the blog __Graph Data Science for Supply Chains Part III: Path Finding, Optimization, and What-If Scenarios (link TBD)__


The notebook relies on an the data from Part1, specifically the Neo4j database created from running [`transform-and-load.ipynb`](https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/demo-supply-chain-logistics/blob/main/part1-getting-started-gds-and-bloom/transform-and-load.ipynb).  For convenience, a Neo4j database dump is also provided [here](https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/demo-supply-chain-logistics/blob/main/data/c2k-case-study.dump), so you can load that into [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/backup-restore/restore-dump/) or [AuraDS](https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-data-science/) instead of regenerating the database via the notebook.
