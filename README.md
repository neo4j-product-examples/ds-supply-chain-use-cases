# Graph Data Science for Supply Chain and Logistics
This repository contains worked examples for applying Neo4j Graph Data Science to supply chain and logistics problems.

Each subdirectory contains its own analytical workflow and worked example (or series of worked examples).

- __`modeling-and-visualization-c2k`__ provides materials to replicate the analysis in [part I of the Graph Data Science for Supply Chains Blog Series](https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/supply-chain-neo4j-gds-bloom/) which focuses on
  1. Graph data modeling and ingest for supply chains
  2. Visualising and exploring supply chains processes
  3. Identifying and inspecting critical stages and interdependent process using low-code/no-code graph algorithms

- __`Metrics-and-performance-analytics-c2k`__  compliments [part II of the Graph Data Science for Supply Chains Blog Series](https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/gds-supply-chains-metrics-performance-python/) and focuses on understanding and analysing supply chain performance using graph.

- __`route-optimzation-c2k`__ contains examples of using Neo4j Graph Data Science for route optimization and recommendation
