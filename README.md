# Graph Data Science for Supply Chain, Logistics, and Transportation
This repository contains worked examples for applying [Neo4j Graph Data Science](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/) to supply chain, logistics, and transportation problems.

Each subdirectory contains its own analytical workflow and worked example (or series of worked examples).

- __`modeling-and-visualization-c2k`__ provides materials to replicate the analysis in [part I of the Graph Data Science for Supply Chains Blog Series](https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/supply-chain-neo4j-gds-bloom/) which focuses on
  1. Graph data modeling and ingest for supply chains
  2. Visualising and exploring supply chains processes
  3. Identifying and inspecting critical stages and interdependent process using low-code/no-code graph algorithms

- __`Metrics-and-performance-analytics-c2k`__  compliments [part II of the Graph Data Science for Supply Chains Blog Series](https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/gds-supply-chains-metrics-performance-python/) and focuses on understanding and analysing supply chain performance using graph.

- __`route-optimzation-c2k`__ contains examples of using Neo4j Graph Data Science for route optimization and recommendation

- __`transportation-network-london-underground`__ demonstrates how to use Neo4j Graph Data Science with [Neo4j Bloom](https://neo4j.com/docs/bloom-user-guide/current/) to explore anf better understand a transportation network. The same methods can also be used for supply chain and logistics networks.
